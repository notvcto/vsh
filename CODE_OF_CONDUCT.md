**All reports are confidential.** We will never share reporter identity without permission.

### What to Include in a Report

- Names/usernames of people involved
- Description of what happened
- Links to relevant content
- Any additional context
- Whether you want to remain anonymous to the accused

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment** - Within 24 hours

4. **Communication** - We inform the reporter of the outcome
5. **Appeal** - Decisions can be appealed to founder (Vic)

### Enforcement Actions

Depending on severity, consequences may include:

**1. Correction**
- **Action:** Private written warning
- **When:** Inappropriate language or unprofessional behavior
- **Effect:** Clarification of standards, request to improve

**2. Warning**
- **Action:** Formal warning with consequences for continued behavior
- **When:** Single violation or series of minor violations
- **Effect:** Temporary restrictions may be imposed

**3. Temporary Ban**
- **Action:** Temporary removal from all community spaces

**4. Permanent Ban**
- **Action:** Permanent removal from all community spaces

- **Effect:** Permanent exclusion from all VSH spaces

### Transparency

- Enforcement decisions are documented privately
- Patterns and statistics shared with community (anonymized)
- Serious bans announced publicly to warn community
- Individual details kept confidential unless reporter agrees otherwise

## Special Considerations

### Technical Disagreements

**Healthy debate is encouraged!** You can:
- Strongly disagree with technical decisions
- Argue for different approaches
- Critique ideas and proposals

Just remember:
- Attack the idea, not the person
- Stay professional and respectful
- Accept that consensus isn't always possible
- Trust the RFC and governance process

**Example - Good:**
> "I disagree with using `nom` for parsing. Here's why I think `pest` is better: [technical reasons]. What do others think?"

**Example - Not Good:**
> "Only an idiot would choose `nom`. Anyone who supports this doesn't understand parsers."

### Beginners

VSH explicitly welcomes beginners. That means:

- **No "RTFM" responses** - If documentation exists, link it kindly
- **No "just Google it"** - Help them learn how to find information
- **No gatekeeping** - Everyone was new once
- **Celebrate learning** - Every question is an opportunity to improve docs

**Example - Good:**
> "Great question! This is explained in the [parser docs](link), but I can see why it's confusing. Here's a simpler explanation: [explanation]. Let me know if that helps!"

**Example - Not Good:**
> "This has been answered 100 times. Search before asking."

### Mistakes

Everyone makes mistakes:
- Code bugs → Normal, just fix them
- Documentation errors → Happens, submit a PR
- Said something wrong → Apologize and move on
- Accidentally offensive → Apologize sincerely, learn, improve

**Intent matters, but impact matters more.** If you hurt someone unintentionally:
1. Apologize
2. Learn why it was hurtful
3. Don't do it again
4. Move forward

## Positive Community Examples
